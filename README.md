# Ackermann-Steering-Geometry-ROS2
This project implements an Ackermann steering control system for a mobile robot, using ROS 2 for communication and Arduino for hardware control. It simulates the steering behavior of a real car, allowing the robot to move and steer based on ROS 2 commands. The robot can navigate environments with standard ROS 2 messages.
